# RSS-Reader
RSS reader written in python, to read your favorite website's news feed and latest posts in a simple rss format.

In order to integrate this rss feeder for a new website other than the one I have made default:
1. Clone the package 
2. Just add your webistes rss feed url in place of the "url" section in the code.
